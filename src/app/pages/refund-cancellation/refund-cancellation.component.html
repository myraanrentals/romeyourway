  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

  <p>
    We value your trust and strive to provide a seamless experience. Please review our policy
    regarding refunds, cancellations, and rescheduling:
  </p>

  <h2>1. Cancellation by Customer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Within 48 hours of scheduled service:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No refund of the advance amount will be provided, regardless of whether the cancellation
          is informed or uninformed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>72 hours or more before scheduled service:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the cancellation is informed, the customer will receive a coupon code equivalent to the
          advance amount, valid for future bookings and adjustable against the new booking amount
          only.
        </li>
        <li>Uninformed cancellations (no prior communication) will forfeit the advance amount.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A full refund will be processed only if the company fails to deliver the service due to any
      circumstances.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Rescheduling Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Customers may reschedule their booking if informed at least 48 hours before the scheduled
      service time, subject to availability.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rescheduling requests made within 48 hours may incur additional charges or be treated as a
      cancellation (no refund).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Payment & Dispute Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If a customer pays the balance amount via PhonePay (Credit/Debit Card, PayPal, etc.), it
      implies:
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Service was rendered as agreed.</li>
        <li>✅ No unresolved issues exist.</li>
        <li>✅ Balance payment = Acknowledgment of satisfactory service.</li>
        <li>✅ Customer agrees not to raise disputes for paid amounts in the future.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

      submit a written request to

      scheduled service.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>False Dispute Penalty:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Liable for transaction fees + 15% penalty.</li>
